      <p>I'm a <span class="ul">front-end developer and visual designer</span> that was born in Japan. Ever since I started designing posters in high school, I began thinking about how communication can be achieved effectively. Here's my story.</p>
      <p>I was born in Japan, spent my childhood in the United Kingdom, and was <span class="ul">educated at an American school in Japan.</span> After graduating from the University College for the Creative Arts in 2008, I began working as a graphic designer and have been <span class="ul">employed in England, Singapore, Japan, and New Zealand.</span></p>
      <p>Although I love the texture of paper and the subtle impression made by a printing press, I wanted to see my design skills go beyond ink and paper. I wanted to be able to offer functional solutions, experiences, and not just visuals. While I was in New Zealand, I taught myself HTML and CSS but hit a road block when I arrived at JavaScript and back-end.</p>
      <p>So in late 2017, I flew back to Japan and attended <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/tokyo">Le&nbsp;Wagon</a>; one of the few English coding bootcamps in Tokyo. 10 hours every weekday for the next 2 months was learning, coding, and coffee.</p>
      <p>The following months I began working on a startup with someone I met at the bootcamp. This was an amazing experience where I got the opportunity to notice that <span class="ul">my background of being raised between cultures and my creative nature, work together remarkably well when it came to analysing and solving problems.</span></p>
      <p>I'm currently working on this <a href="https://www.transroad.jp">startup in Japan</a> and am enjoying this journey.</p>
